# Model Context Protocol Specification

## Protocol Overview

ToolScan-42 is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) designed to monitor and analyze the public perception of Web3 and blockchain technologies. By tracking social media sentiment, particularly on Twitter, ToolScan-42 provides valuable insights into the current state and trends of various tools, frameworks, and platforms in the blockchain ecosystem.

The protocol serves as a crucial decision-making tool for three key stakeholders:

1. **Developers**: Helps identify which technologies are gaining traction and community support, enabling informed choices about which tools to adopt or migrate to.

2. **Investors**: Provides real-time insights into technology trends, helping identify promising projects and technologies that are gaining market momentum.

3. **Entrepreneurs**: Offers market intelligence about which technologies are being well-received by the community, aiding in strategic technology stack decisions for new ventures.

ToolScan-42's analysis goes beyond simple popularity metrics by:
- Tracking sentiment trends over time
- Identifying emerging technologies
- Highlighting potential risks in technology choices
- Suggesting viable alternatives for technologies showing declining adoption

This comprehensive analysis helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions about technology adoption, investment opportunities, and strategic planning in the rapidly evolving Web3 space.

## Core Components

1. **Sentiment Analysis Engine**
   - Twitter data collection and analysis
   - Sentiment classification (trending up, stable, declining)
   - Alternative tool suggestions

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Twitter API integration for data collection
   - MASA API for sentiment analysis
   - Result aggregation and classification

3. **Classification System**
   - üöÄ Trending Up (60%+ positive sentiment)
   - üí§ Stable (neutral sentiment)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Declining (30%+ negative sentiment)

## Interfaces

### ToolSentimentResult Interface
```typescript
interface ToolSentimentResult {
    tool: string;
    sentiment: SentimentClass;
    tweetCount: number;
    positiveTweets: number;
    negativeTweets: number;
    neutralTweets: number;
    insights?: string;
    alternatives?: string[];
    category?: string;
}
```

## Data Flow

1. User submits a Web3 tool/framework for analysis
2. System queries Twitter for recent mentions
3. Tweets are analyzed for sentiment using MASA API
4. Results are classified based on sentiment thresholds
5. Alternative suggestions are generated for declining tools
6. Comprehensive report is returned to user

## Context Management

The system maintains context through:
- 7-day rolling window for sentiment analysis
- Categorized tool classification
- Historical sentiment tracking
- Alternative tool mapping

## Integration Guidelines

1. **API Integration**
   - Requires MASA API key
   - Twitter API access
   - Environment variables setup

2. **Usage**
   ```typescript
   const result = await analyzeWeb3Sentiment("toolName");
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallback to neutral sentiment
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Retry mechanisms for API calls
